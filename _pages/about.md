I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/) group of the [University of Manchester](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/).

I recently received my PhD from the University of Manchester, supervised by Professor [Sophia Ananiadou](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou). My research topic focused on Relation Extraction within and across sentences using graph-based neural models.
During my PhD I spent 3 wonderful months at [AIRC-AIST](https://www.airc.aist.go.jp/en/) in Japan, where I worked with Professor [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/) on Relation and Event Extraction.

Prior to that, I received my MSc and BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) (NTUA). My research involved Sentiment Analysis and Distributional Semantic Models, under the supervision of Professor [Alexandros Potamianos](http://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/).
